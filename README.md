# NCL_install_mac_arm64
This repository guides you how to install NCAR Command Language (NCL) using the source code
NCL was a very useful software in the past. Those started their research life using GrADS, slowly shifted to NCL-NCAR Graphics baecause very useful and nice GUI, very strong user community and readily available functions. Altough, currently NCL is not updated anymore, still it's very useful software to atmospheric (Global/Regional) modeling community. In the past installtion of NCL was extremely easy because of the availability of precompiled binaries for various platforms of OS and compilers (only untarring did the job). In the progress of Mac system, the last few NCL version does have precompiled binaries for Mac system too. Those binaries worked well for Mac system with Intel mother board. But in the very recent years with the development of Mac-M1/Mac-M2/arm64 systems, these precompiled binaries are not working. So the only way to run ncl in these Mac-arm64 is to install it from the source. Installing NCL is a difficult job. Therefore, the NCL installation method for Mac-arm64 systems are described here.
